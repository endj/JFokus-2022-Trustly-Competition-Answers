In this challenge we are given very few instructions or hints, instead we have to puzzle out the answers
by figuring out a pattern in how the machine transforms inputs.

There are many ways to tackle this question but no obvious approach that will lead to a guaranteed answer.
We simply have to use what patterns we can find, make assumptions, backtest our assumptions and backtrace when something does not hold.

The biggest breakthrough we need to figure out the machine is to understand how the input text is transformed.

One approach we might take is to look at the first 2 characters in the first 3 examples and notice this alternating pattern.

xo -> ox -> xo -> ox and so forth.

This pattern seems stable in both ends of the text even though the outputs are growing.

This might give us the hint that some patterns cause the output to increase in size.
The idea to look at pairs of two characters at a time is a little bit of a stretch but can most easily
be guessed in example 2 if we can figure out a way of how growing and repeating patterns are generated.

Once the pattern of using 2 chars at a time is figured out, there is now a consistent way to backtest rules and make assumptions.

The inspiration to this question came from the story of the rosetta stone and its role in understanding hieroglyphics.
It's probably easier to solve using pen and paper then any programming approach.
