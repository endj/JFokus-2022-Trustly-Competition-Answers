You can either just play the game as intended or try to find the answer in the source code.
I did not try to hard to hide the solution, searching for Javascripts base64 decoding method "atob" does not return any results cause the call is hiden using obfuscation techniques.
However, keen eyes might see a string ending with '=' somwhere among the obfuscated code. If you decode the string you find the secret code.
