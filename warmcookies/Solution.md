Since we can't buy 0.687 of a product, we need to round up.

To get how many products we need to buy, we can scale the recipe
for 20 cookies up to 500_000_000.

After some division we get how many products we would need exactly but since we can't
buy half a carton of eggs, we round up all counts to get our answer.
